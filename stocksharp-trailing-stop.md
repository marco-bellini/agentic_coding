# StockSharp (S#) â€“ Add Support for Trailing Stop Orders

## Project Metadata
- **Project Type**: Open-Source Platform Enhancement
- **Repository**: [StockSharp/StockSharp](https://github.com/StockSharp/StockSharp)
- **Primary Language**: C#
- **Project Domain**: Algorithmic Trading
- **Complexity Level**: High
- **Documentation**: [StockSharp Documentation](https://doc.stocksharp.com/)

## Project Background

### Platform Overview
StockSharp is an advanced, open-source algorithmic trading platform designed to support trading across multiple markets, including:
- Stocks
- Forex
- Cryptocurrencies
- Futures
- Other financial instruments

### Current Limitation
The current implementation lacks a comprehensive trailing stop order mechanism, which is a critical risk management tool for traders.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Develop a robust `TrailingStopOrder` implementation
2. Ensure cross-market compatibility
3. Provide flexible configuration options
4. Maintain high performance and minimal overhead
5. Create intuitive user interfaces for configuration

### Strategic Outcomes
- Enhance StockSharp's risk management capabilities
- Provide traders with more sophisticated order management tools
- Increase platform competitiveness in algorithmic trading space

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Trailing Stop Order Class Design

#### Core Class Structure
```csharp
public class TrailingStopOrder : Order
{
    // Trailing specific properties
    public decimal TrailDistance { get; set; }
    public TrailType TrailType { get; set; }
    public decimal ActivationPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal MaxTrailPrice { get; set; }

    // Enumeration for trail types
    public enum TrailType
    {
        Percentage,
        AbsolutePoints
    }

    // Methods for trail logic
    public void UpdateTrailStop(decimal currentMarketPrice) { }
}
```

#### Key Implementation Requirements
- Inherit from base `Order` class
- Support both percentage and absolute point trailing
- Handle various order directions (long/short)
- Implement intelligent stop price adjustment logic

### 2. Trailing Mechanism Specifications

#### Calculation Methods
1. Percentage-Based Trailing
   - Trail distance calculated as a percentage of current price
   - Dynamic adjustment based on market movements

2. Absolute Point Trailing
   - Fixed point distance from market price
   - Consistent tracking mechanism

#### Configuration Parameters
- Trail distance (percentage or points)
- Activation price
- Maximum price adjustment frequency
- Trail reset options

### 3. Exchange and Broker Compatibility

#### Integration Requirements
- Support major exchanges and brokers in StockSharp
- Implement broker-specific adapters
- Ensure serialization/deserialization compatibility
- Handle partial fills and complex order scenarios

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Minimal computational overhead
- Thread-safe implementations
- Efficient price tracking mechanisms
- Low-latency updates

## Key Architectural Components

### Namespace and File Modifications
1. `StockSharp.BusinessEntities`
   - Update `Order.cs`
   - Add `TrailingStopOrder` class

2. `StockSharp.Algo.Strategies`
   - Modify strategy integration
   - Add trailing stop strategy support

3. `StockSharp.Algo.Storages`
   - Update persistence mechanisms
   - Ensure proper serialization

4. `StockSharp.Xaml`
   - Create UI components for configuration
   - Design intuitive order creation interface

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Design and Planning
- Comprehensive requirement analysis
- Class and interface design
- Performance and compatibility assessment

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- Develop `TrailingStopOrder` class
- Implement trailing logic
- Create unit test framework

### Phase 3: Broker Integration
- Develop exchange-specific adapters
- Test across multiple trading platforms

### Phase 4: UI and User Experience
- Design configuration interfaces
- Create example trading strategies
- Develop comprehensive documentation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Edge case scenario validation
- Performance benchmarking

#### Test Scenarios
1. Percentage trailing in volatile markets
2. Absolute point trailing
3. Multi-exchange compatibility
4. Partial fill handling
5. Extreme market condition simulations

### Integration Testing
- Broker-specific validation
- Real-world trading scenario simulations
- Performance impact assessment

## Documentation Requirements

### Technical Documentation
- Detailed class and method documentation
- Configuration guide

2. Handling diverse market conditions
3. Ensuring cross-platform compatibility
4. Managing computational overhead

### Mitigation Strategies
- Efficient algorithmic design
- Extensive testing
- Modular, extensible architecture

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Fully functional trailing stop order implementation
- Seamless integration with existing StockSharp framework
- High performance and reliability

### Quantitative Metrics
- Less than 1ms overhead per order update
- 99.99% accuracy in stop price calculations
- Support for 10+ major exchanges/brokers
